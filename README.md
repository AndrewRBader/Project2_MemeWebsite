# Project2_MemeWebsite
Meme Website with Amber and Andrew

We have developed a cool Meme site (We Meme It!!) with some cool features and an expanding Meme index!

User Stories: 

In this meme site, users can look at the collected meme index contributed to by our users. Users can look at the different memes, edit the descriptions, or come up with new funny titles for the memes. Users can also add to the meme index database as well with the "add a new meme" link!

A cool new feature is the Meme Generator! With this feature, users can copy and paste the URL from any funny image from the internet and create unique bottom and top lines of descriptive jokes or other text!

User Flow: 

The user begins at the home page where he or she can decide whether to interact with the meme index itself or generate his or her own unique memes. If the user choses the generate meme link, the user is redirected to a meme generator page where he or she can chose any funny image from online, copy and paste the image URL into the address field, chose top and bottom text, click "generate a new meme" and see the new funny generated meme!

If the user choses to interact with the meme index via the link on the homepage, the user will be directed to Meme viewing page. When the user clicks on the linked title of a meme, the user is then directed to the Meme's show page. On the show page, the user can edit the meme by clicking on the link above. The user is then redirected to the meme edit page where the user can change the title, add to or modify the description, or change the meme image itself. The user can also add comments and ratings to the Meme show page directly by inputing values in the comment fields below the meme image.

If the user would like to add the meme from the internet, he or she can do so by clicking on the "add new meme" link at the top of the meme index page. In the new meme page, the user can copy and paste a URL of his or her favorite online meme image into the URL input. The user must add a title for the meme and a description. The user can then submit the new, funny meme to the meme database and it will show up on the meme index page for other users to see!

Future features and directions:

We hope to be able to enable the addition of generated memes to the meme index in the future, however conversion of the canvas object to an image object remains to be a challenge. We also hope to implement meme discussions/stories in the future where users can add to discussions using memes only! Other features and activities are being considered for future iterations as well!
